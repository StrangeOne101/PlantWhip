# PlantWhip
Whip players with a vine stemming from your Plantbending! You can even trap them with the vine if you wish!

Usage: Tap sneak while looking at a plant, and click to fire it towards where you are looking. While it's traveling, you can tap sneak again to trap the target in a dome on hit. Shift clicking the dome releases it.
